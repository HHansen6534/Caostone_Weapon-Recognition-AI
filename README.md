# Capstone-Weapon-Recognition-AI
This is the Repository for our Weapon Recognition AI. It includes our code and documentation for our project. Our group members include Dylan Dorough, Adrian Tudur, and Haley Hansen

The folder capstone-final-code contains the code for the entire project. We use a simple webcam for our camera, python, openCV for the object recognition, labelImg for cropping the images, and TensorFlow for training our model. 

Project Description: 

The project's goal is to create a technology that uses object recognition and will be able to recognize weapons in someone's hand or in their pocket, in which is represented by a rubber prop handgun. It will use a high-definition camera to identify the guns from a distance. When the system identifies a threat, it will alert safety personnel of where the threat is located and provide a notification of the threat. The idea is to implement this technology in school surveillance systems to help prevent school shooting tragedies.
